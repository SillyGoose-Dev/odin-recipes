        <li>3/4 cup of grated parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the sausage, ground beef onion and garlic
            in a dutch oven until browned</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, 
            and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, 
            basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel 
            seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ 
            hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 
            minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, 
            remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the 
                bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles 
                lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. 
                Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top 
                with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ 
                cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 
                1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and 
                Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, 
                either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the 
                foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the 
                foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
